The evaluation metrics used to assess the model performance are:

1) Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS):
- Employed as part of the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Measures the sum of squared distances between each data point and its corresponding centroid within a cluster.
- Lower WCSS values suggest better cluster formation, indicating tighter clusters with data points closer to their centroids.


2) Silhouette Score:
- Utilized to evaluate the quality of clusters formed by KMeans clustering.
- Measures the similarity of an object to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
- Silhouette scores range from -1 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates dense, well-separated clusters.
- The average silhouette score across all clusters assesses the overall quality of clustering.
- These evaluation metrics play a crucial role in determining the optimal number of clusters and evaluating the quality of clustering in unsupervised learning tasks. 
  The Elbow method aids in identifying the optimal number of clusters by analyzing WCSS reduction, 
  while the Silhouette Score facilitates the assessment of cluster separation and cohesion, providing insights into the clustering algorithm's performance.
