Evaluation Metrics for Artist, Style, and Genre Classification:

1) Cross-Entropy Loss (Categorical Cross-Entropy):
- Utilized for both training and testing phases to quantify model performance.
- Implemented using nn.CrossEntropyLoss() in PyTorch.
- Measures the discrepancy between model predictions and actual labels.
- Lower values indicate better model performance, as they signify a smaller difference between predicted and actual values.

2) Accuracy:
- Essential metric for assessing classification accuracy.
- Calculated as the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.
- Expressed as a percentage, providing a clear indication of model performance.
- Accuracy values are printed for both training and testing phases, allowing for easy comparison of model performance across different datasets.

3)Misclassification Visualization:
- Offers deeper insights into model performance beyond accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualizes correct and misclassified classes, providing a visual representation of the model's performance.
- Plots the distribution of correct and misclassified labels, aiding in identifying patterns and areas for improvement in the model's predictions.
- These evaluation metrics collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of classification model performance. 
  While cross-entropy loss quantifies the model's learning from the training data, accuracy offers an intuitive understanding of overall classification accuracy. 
  Additionally, misclassification visualization provides valuable insights into specific areas where the model may need improvement, enhancing the interpretability of the model's performance.
